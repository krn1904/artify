## Artify — How to use the app (for users)

Artify is a place to discover unique artwork, meet artists, and request custom pieces.
This guide explains what you can do and how to get around.

### What you can do
- Browse artwork without creating an account.
- Open an artwork to see details and visit the artist’s profile.
- Contact an artist by sending a commission request (requires login).
- After logging in, access your dashboard and manage requests.

### Getting started
1) Go to the homepage.
2) If you just want to explore, click Explore to browse artworks and categories.
3) If you want to commission an artist or save progress, log in or sign up.

### Browsing artwork
- Explore shows a grid of artworks with images, titles, prices, and tags.
- Use the quick category chips (e.g., Paintings, Digital Art, Photography, Sculptures) to filter.
- Click an artwork to view its full details.

### Viewing artwork details
